# Design
## Design Choices
I wanted to make the website feel like a movie theatre so I used a deep blue.

## Fonts
I used the merriweather font style because it looks modern and gives that movie trailer/title look to the font.

The website is structured with a welcome header and a username box, then beneath that there are ten questions that the user is then to work through until they reach the end and click submit and find out what score they achieved.
